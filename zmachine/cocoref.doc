Interactive Fiction Reference Card for the TRS-80 COLOR COMPUTER 2


I. What You Need

Required

- TRS-80 Color Computer 2
- 64K bytes of RAM
- One TRS-80 Color Disk Drive

Optional

- One or more blank, formatted disks (for SAVEs)
- An 80-column line printer and serial printer cable (for SCRIPTing)
- A second Color Disk Drive (for convenience with SAVEs)


II. Loading The Disk

1. Turn on the power to your disk drive(s) and Color Computer.

2. Insert the master story disk into drive #0, with the oval-shaped cutout
   going in first and the label facing to the right.

3. Under BASIC's "OK" prompt, type:

	RUN "GAME" <enter>

   After a few seconds, the following prompt will appear:

	LOADING GAME ...

   The program automatically loads and runs in about 15 seconds.

4. If nothing appears on your TV screen or monitor, or if you receive an
   error message, something is wrong.  Refer to the Troubleshooting
   section for help.


III. Talking To The Game

Whenever you see a prompt (>), the story is waiting for your command.
You may type up to two full lines of text at a time.  If you make
an error, use the back-arrow key to erase it.  Press the ENTER key when
you are finished typing.  The story will respond and the prompt will reappear.

A clicking sound has been added to the keys to make typing easier.  Use the
volume control on your TV set or monitor to change the sound of the clicks.
Certain keys (such as the up- and down-arrows, CLEAR and BREAK) have been
disabled.  You will hear a "boop" sound if you accidently touch one of these
keys.  You will also hear the "boop" if you try to type more than two lines
of text at a time, or if you try to backspace past the beginning of a line.

If a description will not fit on the screen all at once, [MORE] will
appear in the bottom left corner.  Press the space bar (or any other key)
after reading the screen to view the rest of the description.


IV. The Status Line

At the top of your screen, you will see a status line.  The line is updated
after every move to indicate your current location in the story.  Depending
on the story, the status line may also provide other information:

Score

In stories that keep a score, such as the ZORK underground adventure trilogy,
the right side of the status line will look something like this:

	245/920

The number on the left is your score.  The other number tells you how many
moves you have made.  In the example above, you have earned 245 points in
920 moves.

Time

In stories that keep track of time, such as the mystery thriller DEADLINE, the
right side of the status line will look something like this:

	9:22 AM

This indicates the current time in the story.


V. Saving a Story Position

WARNING: Disks used for SAVE and RESTORE are maintained in a special
format and should not be used for any other purpose.  Files of any other
kind stored on the disk will be erased by the SAVE command.

You need a blank, formatted disk to SAVE your position in the story.  You
may SAVE up to five different positions on a blank disk and RESTORE them in
any order.  Each SAVE position is assigned a number from 0 to 4.  You must
specify a position number each time you use the SAVE command, and
you overwrite any position previously SAVEd with that number.  You must use
a different number for each position that you want to SAVE.

To save your current position, type the word SAVE at the prompt (>).  After
pressing the ENTER key, the screen will clear and you'll see the following:

	SAVING GAME
	POSITION 0-4 (DEFAULT = 0):

1. Type a number from 0 to 4 to tell the story which SAVE position on the
   disk should be used, or simply press ENTER to use the default position.
   You will see the message:

	DRIVE 0 or 1 (DEFAULT = 0):

2. Select the drive that will contain the SAVE disk, or press ENTER to use
   the default setting.  You will now see:

	INSERT SAVE DISK IN DRIVE 0 (or 1),
	PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE

3. Insert your SAVE disk into the indicated drive and press a key.
   The disk will spin for a few moments.  You will then be asked to

	INSERT GAME DISK IN DRIVE 0,
	PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE

4. Make sure the master story disk is inserted in drive #0 and press a key.
   If all is well, you'll get the message:

	Ok.

   If you receive an error message, or the game responds with

	Failed.

   consult the Troubleshooting section.


VI. Restoring a Saved Position

To restore a previously saved story position, type RESTORE at the prompt
(>).  Then follow steps 1 through 4 above for SAVE.


VII. SCRIPTing

If you have an 80-column TRS-80 Line Printer (or any equivalent printer that
connects to the serial port on the back of the Color Computer), you may make a
transcript as you go along.

1. Connect the printer to the serial port on the back of your Color
   Computer.

2. Turn on the printer and set it on-line.

3. Load the master disk and start the story as previously described.

4. To start the transcript at any time, type SCRIPT.

5. To stop the transcript, type UNSCRIPT.

6. SCRIPT and UNSCRIPT may be used as often as desired for as long as the
   printer is left on-line.


VIII. Initializing SAVE Disks

Blank disks must be formatted before they can be used to SAVE games.  Use the
standard Disk Extended BASIC command DSKINI to format your disks.  Refer to
the TRS-80 Color Computer Disk System Owner's Manual and Programming Guide for
more information.


IX. Troubleshooting

A. If the program refuses to load properly, if SAVE/RESTORE fails, or if you
   receive an error message, check each of the following points.

1. Make sure your Color Computer and disk drive(s) are connected
   properly and everything is turned on.

2. Make sure the disk is inserted correctly into the drive slot,
   and the drive door is closed.

3. Inspect the master disk and SAVE disk(s) carefully for visible damage.

4. Make sure each disk is in the proper drive.  The master disk can only
   be run from drive #0.  For SAVE/RESTORE, make sure that you have typed
   the correct drive number for the storage disk, and that you have replaced
   the master disk in drive #0 before proceeding with the story.

5. When saving a story position, make sure the write-protect notch on the
   edge of the SAVE disk is not covered.  Also make certain the storage disk
   has been formatted properly.  As a last resort, try a different storage
   disk.

B. If you receive an error message, turn off your Color Computer and reload
   the story following the instructions in Section II.  The problem may be
   only momentary.  If trouble persists, try the following procedure.

   After reloading the master disk and receiving the intial prompt (>),
   type $VERIFY.  The disk will spin for about a minute, and a message
   similar to one of the following will appear:

   a. DISK CORRECT.  This indicates that the story data on the disk is
      intact.  This may indicate a problem with your hardware (probably
      the disk drive).  It is also possible that the story program
      contains a bug.  If you suspect a bug, call the Infocom Technical
      Hotline.

   b. INTERNAL ERROR. This response indicates either
      hardware trouble or disk damage.  Repeat the $VERIFY procedure
      several times.  Also try the procedure on another Color Computer
      system (such as your dealer's).  If you ever get the message DISK
      CORRECT, the problem is probably in your hardware.

      If you repeatedly get an error message on more than one computer,
      the disk is probably damaged.  Please send the master disk ONLY to
      Infocom for testing.
