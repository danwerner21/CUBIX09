    1. INTRODUCTION

          EDT is a fully featured, in-memory, text editor, for use under the
       CUBIX operating system.  It operates in either a line by line,  or  a
       visual screen format.

          In line by line mode, EDT assumes nothing about the terminal,  and
       displays all data in a "glass teletype" format.

          The visual screen format of EDT will work with most 24 line by  80
       character  ASCII  video  terminals,  and  uses  the  "TTY"   terminal
       interface library to achieve terminal independance.

          Consult the "TTY"  manual for information on using  "TTYPATCH"  to
       customize the control codes and function keys used by EDT.

    2. INVOKING EDT

          EDT is invoked with the command  'EDT  <filename>',  if the  named
       file already exists,  EDT will load and edit it,  otherwise  a  blank
       file is presented.

          If the CURSOR POSITIONING string is defined (See "TTYPATCH"),  EDT
       will  automatically  enter  visual  mode,  clearing  the  screen  and
       displaying the first page of the file.  Otherwise, EDT enters line by
       line mode, and prompts for a command with '*'.

          The EDT which is distributed with the CUBIX system  has  no  "TTY"
       entries defined and will default to line mode operation.
    The EDT editor                                                   Page: 2


    3. LINE MODE OPERATION

       3.1 Line ranges

             The line-range is an optional specification which controls  the
          range of lines for which the command has effect.  Unless otherwise
          stated,  the default line-range assumed for each  command  is  the
          "current" line (*).

             The  "current"  line is the line at which EDT is positioned  in
          line by line mode,  and is also the line on which  the  cursor  is
          positioned in visual mode.

             The following are the valid line range formats:

           *        - The "current" line
           /        - The entire file
           =        - The tagged lines
           0        - The end of the file
           <n>      - Line number <n>, (<n> >= 1)
           <r>,<r>  - Range between beginning of two other ranges.

             The  '+'  and  '-'  characters may be used to add or subtract a
          constant value from a line range.

                    eg: '0-12' <- 12 lines from end of file

             If '+' or '-' is used but no range is specified, an offset from
          the current line is assumed.

             The line range specification is entered immediately  preceeding
          the command name.

                         ie: '<r><command> <operands>'

       3.2 C - Copy text

             The  'C'opy command performs a copy  of  the  active  range  of
          lines, placeing the copy directly ahead of the current line.

          Examples:

                    C               - Duplicate current line
                    1,10C           - Copy lines 1 to 10 inclusive
                    =C              - Copy tagged lines

       3.3 D - Delete text

             The 'D'elete command deletes the active range of lines.

          Examples:

                    D               - Delete current line
                    -5,+5D          - Delete 11 lines -5 to +5 from current
                    /D              - Delete entire file
    The EDT editor                                                   Page: 3


       3.4 F - File information

             This command displays information about the file being  edited,
          includes  the  filename,  the  size  of  the  file  in  lines  and
          characters, and the size and position of the specified line range.

          Examples:

                    F               - Display file & current line information
                    =F              - Display file & tagged lines information

       3.5 I - Insert new text

             The  'I'nsert command prompts for  'Input:',  and  inserts  all
          lines typed directly ahead of the active range.  Enter a null line
          to exit.

          Examples:

                    I               - Insert ahead of current line
                    /I              - Insert at start of file
                    0I              - Insert at end of file

       3.6 L - List text in simple form

             The  'L'ist command displays the active  range  of  lines.  The
          display does not include  line  numbers  or  special  indications.
          'L'ist is faster and mode efficent that 'P'rint.

          Examples:

                    L               - List current line
                    /L              - List entire file
                    -10,+10L        - List 21 lines, centered on current

       3.7 M - Move text

             The  'M'ove command moves the active  range  of  lines  to  the
          location directly ahead of the current line.

          Examples:

                    =M              - Move tagged lines
                    +1M             - Interchange active & next line

       3.8 P - Print text (Enhanced 'L'ist)

             The  'P'rint command displays the active range of  lines.  This
          display includes the line  number  which  may  be  preceded  by  a
          special indication flag  ('*'  for current line,  '='  for  tagged
          lines).

          Examples:

                    P               - Display current line
                    /P              - Display entire file

       3.9 Q - Quit (exit) editor

             The  'Q'uit command exits the editor.  This  command  will  not
          allow an exit if unsaved changes are present in the file.

          Examples:

                    Q               - Quit editor

       3.10 QQ - Unconditional 'Q'uit

             The 'QQ'uit command exits the editor unconditionaly.

          Examples:

                    QQ              - Quit unconditionaly.

       3.11 R <filename> - Read file

             The  'R'ead command reads the entire contents of the  specified
          file, and inserts it directly ahead of the active range.

          Examples:

                    Rabc            - Insert file 'abc' at current
                    /Rabc           - Insert file 'abc' at start
                    0Rabc           - Append file 'abc' at end

       3.12 S<dc><search><dc><replace> - Substitute

             The  'S'ubstitute command searches the active range  of  lines,
          and replaces all occurrances  of  the  string  <search>  with  the
          string  <replace>.  The  <dc>  delimiter  character  may  be   any
          character not contained within the <search> string.

          Examples:

                    S'abc'def       - Change 'abc' to 'def' in current
                    /S'abc'def      - Change 'abc' to 'def' in entire file

       3.13 T - Tag lines

             The 'T'ag command tags the active range of lines, allowing them
          to be referred to by '=' in a subsequent command range.

          Examples:

                    T               - Tag current line
                    1,10T           - Tag lines 1 to 10
                    *,+5T           - Tag six lines starting at current

       3.14 V - Switch Visual Mode

             The 'V' command causes EDT to switch visual modes.  This enters
          visual mode if EDT was previously in line by line mode, and enters
          line by line mode if previously in visual mode.

          Examples:

                    V               - Switch visual modes

       3.15 W [filename] - Write to file

             The  'W'  command writes the active range of lines to the named
          file, or to the original file edited if no name is specified.  Use
          of this command also resets the FILE CHANGED flag,  allowing  exit
          via 'q'.

             The default line range assumed for 'W'rite is the entire file.

          Examples:

                    W               - Write entire file
                    *W              - Write current line
                    Wabc            - Write entire file to 'abc'
                    =Wabc           - Write tagged lines to 'abc'

       3.16 X [filename] - Write file and eXit

             This command behaves exactly as the  'W'rite command,  followed
          immediatly by a  'Q'uit command.  It provides a shorthand  way  of
          saving your file and leaving the editor.

          Examples:

                    X               - Write file & exit
                    Xabc            - Write to 'abc' and exit

       3.17 ?<text> - Search for text

             The '?' command moves the active line to the first occurance of
          the specified string within the active range.

             The default range assumed for  '?'  is one character  past  the
          current cursor position (in visual mode) or the first character of
          the active line (In line by line mode),  through to the end of the
          file.

          Examples:

                    ?string         - Find next occurance of "string"
                    /?string        - Find first occurance of "string"
    The EDT editor                                                   Page: 6


       3.18 $<command> - Execute CUBIX command

             The  '$'  command executes the specified  CUBIX  command.  Care
          should be taken to execute only internal  comands,  and  utilities
          which return via 'RTS' and do not overwite the EDT image in ram.

          Examples:

                    $files          - Execute 'files' command

       3.19 <no command> - Goto line

             If a line range is given without a command, EDT will reposition
          the "current" line to the beginning of that range.

          Examples:

                    100             - Move to line 100
                    /               - Move to start of file
                    0               - Move to end of file
                    =               - Move to tagged line(s)

    4. VISUAL MODE OPERATION

          When in VISUAL mode,  EDT presents a window on the terminal screen
       which displays the contents of a section of the file.  Editing of the
       file may be performed directly on the  screen  via  special  function
       keys,  and the screen is updated so that you see your changes as they
       are being performed.

       4.1 Entering text

             Text may be entered into  the  file  being  edited,  simply  by
          typeing it at the terminal keyboard.  EDT automatically places the
          text in the file,  and updates  the  screen  to  reflect  the  new
          contents.  The position  of  the  terminal  cursor  indicates  the
          position at which the text will be entered.

             The arrow keys on the terminal may be used to move  the  cursor
          around the displayed image.  Moveing  beyond  the  bottom  of  the
          screen causes EDT to scroll forward one line, and shift the screen
          up.  Moveing beyond the top of the screen  causes  EDT  to  scroll
          backward one half screen,  and redisplay the text.  If the end  of
          the file is within the area  shown  on  the  screen,  the  message
          '*EOF*' is displayed in special video.

       4.2 Visual mode function keys

             The following terminal keys must be defined  using  "TTYPATCH",
          and have special meaning to EDT:

          4.2.1 Right arrow

                Moves the cursor forward one character positon in the  file,
             if at the end of a line,  the cursor will advance to the  first
             position of the next line.

          4.2.2 Left arrow

                Moves the cursor backward one character positon in the file,
             if at the beginning of a line,  the cursor will backup  to  the
             last position of the previous line.

          4.2.3 Up arrow

                Moves the cursor up one line.  If at the top of the  screen,
             the display will scroll backwards by one half a screen page.

          4.2.4 Down arrow

                Moves the cursor down one line.  If at  the  bottom  of  the
             screen, the display will scroll forward by one line.

                The cursor may appear to jump back and forth as it is  moved
             up and down,  if it ancounters lines which are shorter than the
             current character position within  the  line,  or  lines  which
             contain tabs.  This is because whenever possible, the cursor is
             returned to the same number of  physical  characters  from  the
             start of the line as is was on the first line from which the UP
             or DOWN arrow was pressed.

          4.2.5 Page up

                This key  pages  backward  one  screen.  (Top  line  becomes
             bottom)

          4.2.6 Page down

                This key pages forward one screen. (Bottom line becomes top)

          4.2.7 Page right

                Moves the cursor to the end of the line.  If already at  the
             end of a line, it is moved to the end of the next line.

          4.2.8 Page left

                Moves the cursor to the beginning of  the  line.  If  it  is
             already at the  beginning  of  a  line,  it  is  moved  to  the
             beginning of the previous line.

          4.2.9 Home

                This key moves the cursor to the beginning of the first line
             in the file.

          4.2.10 End

                This key moves the cursor to the end of the file.

          4.2.11 Delete character

                Deletes the character under the cursor,  without moving  the
             cursor.

          4.2.12 Delete previous

                Moves the cursor backward to the  previous  character,  then
             deletes that character.

          4.2.13 Clear screen

                Redraws the screen image of the file.  This is normally used
             in the case of the screen being corrupted by data  transmission
             errors,  or asynchronus messages from the operating  system  or
             its users.

          4.2.14 Function key 1

                Prompts for a line mode command,  and executes it.  See  the

          4.2.16 Function key 3

                Toggles between character  INSERT  and  OVERWRITE  mode.  In
             INSERT mode,  all characters typed at the terminal are inserted
             into the text.  In OVERWRITE mode,  only the NEWLINE  character
             and data entered at the end of a line is  inserted,  all  other
             characters will overwrite the existing text.

          4.2.17 Function key 4

                Toggles ON/OFF the display of NEWLINE characters at the  end

          4.2.20 Function key 7

                Tags one or more lines for a  later  operation.  The  tagged
             lines are displayed in special video if the  terminal  supports
             it.  Once one line is tagged, pressing this key on another line
             causes all lines between them to be tagged.  Pressing it  again
             on the first line of the tagged range removes the tags.

          4.2.21 Function key 8

                Deletes from the cursor position to  the  end  of  the  line
